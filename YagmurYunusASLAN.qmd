My name is Yagmur Yunus ASLAN.



In short I,

After graduating from TOBB University of Economics and Technology with a grade point average of 3.53, I worked as a long-term intern at Havelsan and Roketsan for about 1 year, participating in business process modeling, defense industry, and space systems projects. Then I am now an engineer at Roketsan and studying MSc at Hacettepe University. I am proficient at the intermediate-upper level in English, and I have Spanish proficiency at the basic level. As an engineer constantly learning and improving himself, I am excellent at analytical thinking and problem-solving.
